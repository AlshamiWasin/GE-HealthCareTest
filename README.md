Template typescript project

```javascript
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Notes:
i was not sure if i should make a hand watch or a actual clock , so i chose to make a clock.

functions i could have implemented:

1. A function to remove or delete a clock.
2. A function to switch the gmt offset of a watch.
3. Input validation for the GMT offset that (only allowsfrom -12 to +14)
   thank you for the test
4. Create a app class where I can have the displpay clock functions inside
