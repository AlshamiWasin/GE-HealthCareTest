Template typescript project

```javascript
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

Notes:
i was not sure if i should make a hand watch or a actual clock , so i chose to make a clock.

functions i could have implemented:

1. A remove clock function.
2. A function to switch the gmt offset of a watch.

thank you for the test
